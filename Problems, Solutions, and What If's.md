FACstamp addresses a wide range of problems currently faced in our world today.  Most of the issues arise from the unbridled or perhaps irresponsible or non virtuous use of the internet and the proliferation of social media outlets combined with the rise of undemocratic political parties and leaders.  A short summary list of the problems that FACstamp addresses and its respective solutions.  The second list is more of a hypothetical list of potential problems that FACstamp can also address.

1) ## Problems Addressed by FACstamp

#### 1\) Discernment of historical truth and accuracy

There is no easy way for content consumers to differentiate historical fact from fiction.  This is particularly true for the average content consumer and voter.  Even news and information geeks can find it challenging and time consuming.  Note the discernment between false and truth for any given Content is not just momentary \- the discernment continues post consuming the information.  In addition, knowing the accuracy prior to consuming the information saves time.

FACstamp directly supports this by supplying a color coded cryptographic digital stamp where the color coding is the live historical fact FIT status (False, Indeterminate, True) and KS rating (Known, Suspected).  Clicking the stamp or snapping the QR code will take the consumer to the FACstamp portal for that content where the user can spelunk for more provenance and version information as well as the FACstamp network graph of any FACstamp references or backlinks.  It is important to note that the FIT and K/S status is live and based on real and current data \- it can change over time.  All FACstamp data is contained in a public ledger which records all transactions, so nothing is lost and FACstamp data history cannot be changed without significant notice.

Note that no Consumer FACstamp License agreement or login is required to access this information.  However the portal is limited to human interaction while API access is available as a subscription service.

#### 2\) Discernment of the virtue of the intent and demagogic aspects of Content

There is no easy way for content consumers to determine the intent of the content producer/purveyor as to whether it is virtuous or not, and if any demagoguery is contained in the content whether the demagoguery is of good and virtuous or of evil and vicious intent.

FACstamp also addresses this problem with the same solution as above since the color coded FIT and K/S rating include both fit-for-use requirements [one](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Y19Q_lXc3HiICJrnWFcV4ryuoSX_Xed1yCuLQEqSmU8/edit) and [two](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1o73JdA-ISa4UKf237Z1UJCxXmPpC7zTAhT2jdp-I9lY/edit).

#### 3\) The questioning and Updating of the Fitness-For-Use of Content

There is no easy way for a consumer to question the validity of online content and potentially correct the historical accuracy or the flavor and alignment of the demagoguery in terms of both intent and impact contained within.

For those willing and capable of signing a FACstamp End User License Agreement, FACstamp offers a shepherded, guided, and AI enhanced fitness-for-use warranty claim process by which any individual or group of consumers can file a warranty claim against the content producer/purveyor.  FACstamp is public ledger based so all claims, counter claims, content, and changed content is all tracked in a fully public ledger.  Both licensed and unlicensed users can also track the progress of any claim.

#### 4\) Content Producers/Purveyors can lie without consequences

There are no consequences for Content Producers/Purveyors (and political leaders, corporations, government, etc) when their Content contains lies, misinformation, and vicious and unvirtuous demagoguery.

FACstamp supports a safe, shepherded, and IA enhanced fitness-for-use warranty claim process by which any individual or group of individuals can make a claim against the Content producer/purveyor.  If the claim is upheld by the arbitration process defined in the producer and consumer FACstamp license agreements, the producer/purveyor is liable for the claimed damages by the Content consumer. 

#### 5\) The government/FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine \- news has become unbalanced

In 1987 the FCC and President Reagon abolished the [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_doctrine), which allowed the unrestrained rise of vicious, unvirtuous, and unbalanced demagoguery as news.  FACstamp brings the Fairness Doctrine back into existence in a more First Amendment friendly and voluntary manner by focusing on the ethical and unbiased intent of any creator and content, not just FCC controlled airspace.  In addition the arbitration is accomplished in a private, distributed, and nongovernmental manner while aligning it more closely with modern social media and online content practices and norms.

#### 6\) Too few political parties respect historical accuracy and virtuous intent and demagogic rhetoric

At the moment one major political party appears to not manifest virtuous demagogic rhetoric while another major political party appears uncertain of the value and need of virtuous demagoguery.  A benefit of FACstamp is that it allows all political parties to create historically accurate Content and optionally add aligned and virtuous demagoguery to help motivate the electorate to actively, responsively, and wisely participate in democracy.

#### 7\) Nuancing the conflicts between science and stoic virtue and conflicting beliefs/faiths

When FACstamped historical accuracy or virtuous delivery  ‘appears’ to contradict an aspect of a belief system that an individual or group has identified with, science and/or stoic virtue can become an enemy.  FACstamp’s Requirement 1 honors the Consumer’s supremacy of conscious and free choice and attempts to not threaten Consumers so identified \- they should be able to feel safe and unthreatened reading FACstamp Content.  However, that does not mean that the Content does not describe actions, events, and aspects associated with the belief system in a positive or supportive manner.  Evil, hate, violence, and non virtuous actions and events can be (need to be) called out; it is just that they are called out in a manner that still respects to the extent possible the common humanity shared by us all.  FACstamp Content supports as much as possible the inclusion of all people while ‘calling out’ unvirtuous, evil, unscrupulous, or violent actions and events.

#### 8\) Nuancing the difference between good and bad science is challenging

As powerful and beneficial science can be, science can also do great harm.  In FACstamped Content is important to incorporation weaponization by simplification and remove the nuance between good and bad science.  Science can be bad in two fundamental ways.  Bad science can simply be unscientific \- bad science does not follow the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), is not transparent, and can contain [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) as well as other biases.

As scientific studies can be good or bad even after peer review and publication, FACstamp helps both the general public and the scientific community (all Content Consumers) helps track the current state of scientific accuracy of FACstamped Content via the FACstamp public ledger and the always live FIT and K/S status.

#### 9\) Nuancing the difference between good and bad logic is challenging

Similar to nuancing the difference between good and bad science above (1.8), FACstamp helps Consumer, Producers, and Purveyors nuance the difference between good and [fallacious logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy).  Though logic is usually absent in demagogic rhetoric, virtuous demagogic rhetoric can be aligned with FACstamped Content the directly supports it.  

#### 10\) Basic stoic virtue, wisdom-consciousness, of the consumer is not prioritized

Many modern cultures effectively do not prioritize what can be traced back to historic stoic virtues or other virtue systems.  Another effective name for stoic virtue is wisdom-consciousness, which speaks to the inherent wisdom that can be expressed by wise individuals and many cultures.  The FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty claim process shepherds both the Consumer and Producer/Purveyor through a wisdom-consciousness based process, whether that process is implemented via [Nonviolent Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) or leverages [Braver Angels](https://braverangels.org/).  As warranty claims are processed, those directly involved and those following have the opportunity to see respectful, nonviolent resolutions of conflicts occur.

#### 11\) The collective consciousness of 1-10 million voters needs to be increased

For democracies to persist and flourish, a working effective majority of the electorate needs to function at a minimum level of wisdom-consciousness discernment so as to be able to disambiguate fact from falsehood (and the relative likelihood of each) as well as good and bad demagoguery.  As referenced multiple places above, the FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty claim process as a direct side effect shepherds Consumers and Producers/Purveyors along their own personal path both individually and collectively towards greater discernment and wisdom-consciousness due to the ‘love centeredness” of [requirement 2](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1o73JdA-ISa4UKf237Z1UJCxXmPpC7zTAhT2jdp-I9lY/edit) is included.

As more voters shift along these lines, democracies become inherently stronger and more resistant to bad science, vicious and non virtuous intent and demagoguery.  This shift is not a guaranteed result but the ‘love centeredness’ maximizes the chance of this happening while supporting the people and processes involved in helping this shift occur.

2) ## Additional Downstream FACstamp Opportunities

Only human beings can obtain a FACstamp license and a [FACID](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1YVqu2WcwWs4DcwRit71nmY71KicRNEKGxInupWymlyE/edit), and both are required to create FACstamps.  Bots, software and AI programs, businesses, corporations, and governments cannot FACstamp content.  Given this restriction and the Producer/Purveyor and Consumer license restrictions, secondary, downstream, and indirect use cases can come into play.  Some of these are:

#### 1\) Social media content providers may FACstamp their content

#### To differentiate their content from other content providers, social media content providers will begin to FACstamp their content.  As FACstamp becomes more well known, the desire to FACstamp becomes greater.  This growth comes from both reader demand (hierarchical bottom-up pressure) as well as from producer/purveyor desires (hierarchical top-down pressure).

#### 2\) Social media sites may require a FACID for uploading comments

Independently from FACstamp usage, social media Producers/Purveyors may require reviewers and commenters to obtain a FACID to upload content.  By requiring FACTIDs such sites achieve a high degree of assurance that the commenter is a human.  Note that though FACIDs can be stolen similar to cryptocurrency keys, unlike crypto keys the nature of FACTIDs and their continuous FACID 2FA process that minimizes stolen keys remaining stolen.

#### 3\) Social media subscribers might require FACstamps for news and information

As FACstamps become more well known, social media subscribers may require FACstamps on the articles they consume before consuming them.  This is the first tipping point in the [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp) of FACstamps \- consumes start to filter their social media, news, and information portals by the existence of FACstamp \- non FACstamp content lands in a different inbox/bucket/thread.

#### 4\) Social media subscribers might require FACstamps for ads, marketing, and advertisements

This is the second tipping point of FACstamp [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), when either consumers configure (prioritize or require) ads and marketing material to be FACstamped or when the advertisers initiate FACstamp usage themselves to differentiate their products and services.

#### 5\) Private and public events, such as rallies, marches, and demonstrations, may ask participants to register/link their FACIDs

In any private or public gathering, in person or online, the organizers may ask the participants to identify themselves with FACIDs.  Note that FACIDs support known anonymity, meaning that that actual identity of the FACID may not be known even while the FACID is known to be currently valid.  This can be done within say ‘micro-groups’ within the larger group or as a single group.  For example, the organizers may ask the participants to use their FACID to identify their immediate neighbors and while doing so to agree to event guidelines such as non-violent behavior and other safety guidelines.  It also can give the organizers an exact count of the number of people attending even when such information is anonymous (FACID owners always control the degree of anonymity of their FACID usage).

#### 6\) Brick & mortar establishments may leverage FACstamps

Brick and mortar establishments may display a business owner/operator FACstamp to denote a promise of some level of civil engagement or provenance of available physical goods, such as food, and services, in addition to any available Content, if any.  The FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty (the two FACstamp requirements) can be used to extend the coverage to for example the organic nature, non GMO nature, or carbon footprint cost of goods and services.  The displayed FACstamp that contains the warranty extension can be recorded by the customer and potentially be used to make a future warranty claim if for example the purchased goods and services do not meet the extended fitness-for-use warranty.

#### 7\) Hierarchical power structures such as businesses, corporations, and governments, can be employees/citizens

Regarding hierarchical power structures such as businesses, corporations, and governments, employees/citizens might micro-share their FACIDs (with a certain level of anonymity) to gain critical mass of FACID adoption.  With a certain level of adoption the employees/citizens could ask other levels in the hierarchy to also obtain/use FACID/FACstamps.  The goal is to raise FACID/FACstamp compliance in the hierarchical organizations and communities in which they participate.  The moral dilemma being addressed by this scenario is the problematic reality that money and power corrupts \- it is challenging to remain virtuous as one gains power and wealth.  The idea is that as a group within a hierarchical power structure gains critical FACID adoption, the group can ask another hierarchical group to also obtain and use FACIDs and FACstamps.

#### 8\) Voters might ask their elected and non-elected officials to obtain FACIDs/FACstamps and to agree to conduct their official duties under their EULAs

As FACstamps do not differentiate between the private and public sector, FACstamps can be leveraged in the political sector as well.  Political candidates may start using FACstamps to attract voters.  In addition, to the extent legally possible elected officials may be required to create FACstamped Content particularly as background material to what otherwise could be unbridled and non virtuous demagoguery.

#### 9\) FACIDs could be leveraged significantly beyond FACstamp usage

Given the connection between FACIDs and public voter registration, FACIDs might be leveraged by existing public voting registration systems as additional checks during the voting registration and voting process, whether in person or online voting.

#### 10\) The license agreements behind FACID and FACstamps could be used as templates

If properly written and organized, the FACID and FACstamp license agreements might be leveraged as a non-partisan vision statement regarding fundamental guardrails concerning news and information and the free and responsible civil discourse and exchange thereof.

Note that FACstamp and FACID would both be trademarked and heavily defended from infringement, limiting the potential look-alike fakes and hacks.

3) ## Can FACIDs and FACstamps improve generative AI Models?

FACIDs and FACstamps are limited to human beings.  To be sentient and conscious is a requirement for the ability to assess historical accuracy of content as well as its virtuous delivery.  Bots and software programs, AI based or otherwise, and businesses, corporations, and governments cannot obtain either FACIDs or FACstamps.

Regarding AI models, for example LLM chat and search sites, what if the officers of the company producing the AI model were able to combine their personal FACstamps to create a special generative AI model FACstamp?  The generative FACstamp would furnish two important guardrails regarding generative AI Content:

1) A generative AI FACstamp would provide a liability barrier between the generative AI model end-users, who may be FACID owners, and the officers of the company.  Limiting such liability would support greater possibilities for investment and innovation.  
2) A generative AI FACstamp would provide a provenance and fitness-for-use of the content being generated and consumed.  As artificial intelligence is not the same thing as consciousness, there is significant social and civic interest for the ability to determine the fitness-for-use of generative AI content.  As FACID and FACstamp information is both ‘live’ and versioned via public ledger technology similar to blockchain technologies, generative AI as well as its end-users can more deeply investigate FACID and FACstamp provenance and hence provenance in general.  
   

In summary a generative AI FACstamp could be of high value to society.
