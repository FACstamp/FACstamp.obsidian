As with all new technology markets, it is challenging to accurately predict potential market size and revenue potentials.  The FACstamp project, if successful, will create both a highly accurate generic internet cryptographic identity (FACID) as well as a new type of Data Rights Management (DRM) for digital content that can be used in many new and profound ways.

Beyond the minimal licensing fees for FACstamp licenses paid to the FACstamp 501(c)(3) structured to sustain the nonprofit, FACstamp licensees can optionally attach fee structures to the stamps that they create.  Thus accessing FACstamp content can either be free or fee based in a plethora of ways.

For example and similar to how iTunes shifted the music industry from downloads to streaming, FACstamp has the direct capability for media producers and purveyors to choose between monthly subscription and per view based revenue models.  FACID owners can opt in to a monthly FACstamp based charge where that revenue is spread across the stamps that they view.

It is also possible to restrict product reviews and blog and social media comments as well as the channels themselves to FACID users.  This will significantly increase the value of the review and comments.

Regarding AI digital content, since FACIDs are restricted to human beings with a registerable voting address, as AI content increases again FACID and FACstamps will increase the value of human generated content.  In addition, with a compliant aiFACstamp (a group of FACstamp licensees can create a special federated FACstamp that can be used for specific AI generated content), the value of AI generated stamped content increases in value.

All these revenue, quality, and fitness-for-use markets are between the FACstamp licensee and the consumer end-user and not directly associated with the non-profit holding entity.  This is for several reasons only one of which is to help generate adoption and maximize network effects.

In summary, FACIDs have the ability to shift large segments of the internet from being anonymity based (is there a real human being behind this comment?) to being restricted to unique and real human beings with known but still anonymous attributes (is this comment by someone in my voting district or by someone from another country?).  The market for this and related and downstream products and services is challenging to define.
