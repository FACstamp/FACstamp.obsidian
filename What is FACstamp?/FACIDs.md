Several fundamental key aspects of FACstamps require a verified and continually re-verified online identity associated with an unique real human being with a specific postal address.  The postal address is the same as the person’s voter registration address or potential voter address if the person could and were to register to vote.  This FACstamp identity is referred to as a FACID.

Note - all voter registration information in the form of a name and an address is already publicly available information.  However, with FACIDs and FACstamps this otherwise public information is only shared in specific situations in specific ways.

#### FACIDs - an authenticatable, online identity with privacy

A FACID secures online identities with various private, public, and anonymous attributes.  With a FACID, one can [digitally sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) social media and other content indicating legitimate authorship.  Obtaining a FACID requires installing a FACID app to authenticate one’s identity with certain bio and geo location requirements (for example, with an integration similar to [Clear and LinkedIn](https://www.clearme.com/partner-detail-pages/linkedin) in addition to a GPS integration).  The applicant’s home address and name must match their public voter registration information.  If unregistered or if ineligible to vote, the address and name would need to match the legitimate address and name they would otherwise use to register to vote.

The process of authenticating requires several conditions to be met beyond a legal name and address, including the need to have other existing FACID users physically present to authenticate an applicant’s identity  and address.  The app could indicate the locations of other existing FACID users as well as the nearest FACID administrators for assistance.  The FACID registration process requires a downloaded FACID app to communicate with the other FACID apps.  Finally, to obtain a FACID also would require signing a FACID EULA (End User License Agreement) that specifies terms of use of the ID.  Both the EULA and the authentication process are described in greater detail in other FACID documents.  Note \- different levels of authentication will probably be supported.

Unlike cryptocurrency systems with their completely private token ownership identities, FACID’s behave in a manner in which the name and address of the FACID can be privately shared with other FACID users as desired.  The FACID network, the relationship of FACID’s authenticating other FACID’s at both ‘home’ and non-home locations, has no analogy with cryptocurrency systems.  However, like cryptocurrencies both the FACstamp and FACID networks have open source public ledgers behind them maintaining the data and changes thereof.

FACID's have strong boundaries of anonymity, partial identification, and full identity.  And within these operational boundaries, a FACID is tied to voter registration in terms of name and address.  Note that corporations, governments, and AI implementations can neither obtain a FACID nor stamp content with a FACstamp.  However, it is possible for a group of FACIDs to sign an [[aiFACstamp]] License Agreement allowing for AI generated content to be digitally stamped in an analogous manner via an AI Expressed Warranty of Merchantability.

Regardless, a FACID is tied to a real person, legitimate voter registration (or equivalent information), a real location, an EULA, and is mutually and multiply authenticated by other FACID users.
