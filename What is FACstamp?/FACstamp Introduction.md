## What is FACstamp?

FACstamp is a cryptographic digital stamp for news and information a.k.a. Content.  FAC stands for Fostering Accuracy, Authenticity, and Community in Communications and Content.  It is a cross between the [Underwriters Laboratory](https://www.ul.com/) (UL) seal regarding electronic equipment and the [Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/) regarding consumer products applied to news and information, i.e. content.  FACstamp offers a [fit-for-use](https://code.dccouncil.gov/us/dc/council/code/sections/28:2-315) warranty on news, data, and information where fit-for-use covers two primary warranties referred to as [[Requirement 1]] and [[Requirement 2]]:

- [[Requirement 1]]:  that FACstamped content that pertains to verifiable historical events is indeed accurate  
- [[Requirement 2]]: that all FACstamped content be delivered to the consumer in a responsible, respectful, and virtuous manner

As FACstamps target content on the World Wide Web, FACstamps rely on internet based identities managed by [[FACIDs]].  FACIDs provide provenance of authorship, which is referred to as [[Requirement 0]].
## How are FACstamps created and used?

Content producers and purveyors can FACstamp (digitally sign) their content to offer a fitness-for-use warranty to the consumers of the content, differentiating their content from non-FACstamped content.  Consumers can click-verify the FACstamp and gain confidence that the content abides by the two aspects of the fitness-for-use warranty.  Both producers and consumers can rely on and leverage a fair and safe warranty claim process to address actual or perceived lapses in the fitness-for-use warranty.  Note that content producers must agree to a FACstamp Content Producer Software License before gaining the ability to create FACstamps, and consumers must agree to a FACstamp Consumer License before making a warranty claim.  These licenses define the warranty claim process facilitating quick, fair, and respectful warranty claim resolution.  The warranty claim process is seen as a potential wisdom-conscious expanding activity for both producers and consumers.

Note that the FACstamp network also automatically provides live provenance resolution of FACstamp references where FACstamp content includes references to other FACstamp content.

## What problems is FACstamp solving?  What are its project goals?

[[Internet Problems and FACstamp Solutions]] summarizes the problems that FACstamp is attempting to address.  Three primary goals of FACstamp are:
- To foster historical accuracy where such accuracy can be reasonably determined  
- To increase the wisdom, virtue, and discernment of the communities served both on an individual and collective basis  
- To foster real human community, both real and online, particularly via news and information portals and the provenance thereof
