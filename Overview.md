The FACstamp project attempts to address the current low level of historical accuracy and virtuous intent behind social and mainstream media news and information, both for content producers/purveyors and for content consumers.  FACstamp tries to achieve this in a *wise* manner, particularly with respect to the FACstamp warranty claim process.

- 1) See [[FACstamp Pitch]]

The primary civic goal of FACstamp is to provide an easy and fast ‘click-able’ button for both content producers/purveyors and consumers to determine the historical accuracy and virtuous intent of news and media content.  This capability includes distinguishing between human and AI based content and entities.  FACstamp does this in a distributed manner without a central agency making that determination \- the central agency, a 501(3)(c) non-profit, only maintains the legal and technical frameworks.

The primary societal goal of FACstamp concerns the fitness-for-use warranty claim process where common aspects of [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/), the [Braver Angel](https://braverangels.org/) initiative, as well as other wisdom/spiritual traditions such as Christianity, are leveraged during warranty claims.  The FACstamp social goal is to raise the effective collective consciousness of society in general and in particular of the voting electorate regarding our common humanity.  And to accomplish this while also advancing goals specific to the selected wisdom traditions.

The primary financial goal beyond self maintenance of the non-profit are the increased profits of FACstamp producers/purveyors and associated ad revenue.  The FACstamp non-profit is here for others.
