A primary goal of FACstamp is to positively affect 1-10 million voters within one year of general availability of Minimal Viable Product (MVP).  By increasing the collective consciousness of the voting electorate, the US democracy is stabilized against misinformation, civic decay, and the loss of virtue particularly within the government.

The initial financial FACstamp goal is a two step fund raising campaign within one GoFundMe campaign.  The first financial goal is $1500 for:
- $1000 to set up a 501(c)(3)  
- $500 for various IT/ISP/website costs for 1-2 years

The second financial goal is an additional $35k for:
- $12,500 to establish a trademark claim (no code \- manual FACstamp creation)  
- $22,500 to create a professional \~3 minute FACstamp video explanation

The reason for the two steps is that a primary goal of the GoFundMe campaign is to create enough community interest and engagement so to be able to convene a small charrette of 4-6 volunteers to work out white paper prototypes of the warranty claim process.  WIth the initial $1,500 the legal and financial frameworks can be set up to facilitate both the convening of the charrette and the transparent and focused use of the remaining $35k.  It is probably the case that the FACstamp video explanation cannot be completed until the charrette has mostly finished its work.

The initial community engagement goal is to create a working charrette (board of directors) whose initial tasks are to:

- Define the high level workflows including the warranty claim process  
- Define the high level UX (user experience) of producers, purveyors, and consumers  
- Define initial and effective ways of meeting people where they are  
- Create buzz and excitement in select and limited circles  
- Create enough of a white paper prototype to facilitate further investments

The current plan is to create a GoFundMe presence to both raise the initial $37k and to create a pool of interested backers from which the working board of directors can be composed.  The size of the board is currently targeted to be between 4 to 6 people.

Post the initial financial and engagement goals, the short term roadmap targets an initial investment round of $475,000 for investigation and prototyping that are needed to define a minimum viable product (MVP).  A second investment round of $1.2M targets the delivery of the MVP.
