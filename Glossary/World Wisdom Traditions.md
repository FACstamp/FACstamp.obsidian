*World wisdom traditions* refer to religions and non-religious life philosophies that have a wisdom/love grounding aspect to them.  A few examples follow:
#### Atheist / Agnostic / Humanist

#### Baháʼí
#### Buddhism
Buddhism is heavily based on a form of love, specifically universal, selfless, and unconditional love, rather than just romantic or possessive attachment. It focuses on cultivating compassion, loving-kindness, and non-harming towards all beings to achieve inner peace and liberation.

**Key Aspects of Love in Buddhism**
- **The Four Immeasurables:** The core of Buddhist love includes:
    - **Metta (Loving-kindness):** Wishing happiness for all beings.
    - **Karuna (Compassion):** Wanting to alleviate the suffering of others.
    - **Mudita (Sympathetic Joy):** Feeling joy for others' success and happiness.
    - **Upekkha (Equanimity):** Maintaining a balanced, non-attached mind.
- **Love vs. Attachment:** While ordinary, personal love often stems from attachment, Buddhism encourages a form of love that is free from selfish clinging, which reduces suffering for both yourself and others.
- **Universal Scope:** Buddhist love is not restricted to family or romantic partners but extends to all living beings, including enemies.
- **Action-Oriented:** This love is not just a feeling but is expressed through actions, thoughts, and speech that support others' well-being.

Essentially, Buddhist teachings aim to transform the mind to move from selfish, limiting love toward a state of boundless, unconditional love.
#### Christianity
Even though there are what can be called conservative and liberal interpretations of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, the most basic tenet of Christianity, as summarized in [Matthew 22:34-40](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=22&startverse=34&endverse=40), is to love thy God and thy neighbor and on these all laws shall rest.
#### Hinduism
Hinduism is fundamentally love-centered, with divine love (Brahman) seen as the core essence of the universe, often expressed through deep devotion (Bhakti) and selfless service (Seva). It emphasizes cultivating love for the divine, treating all beings with respect, and achieving liberation through passionate, selfless connection to God. 
#### Judaism
#### Indigeneity - Indigenous American
Indigenous spirituality, often centered on the concept of the Great Mystery (Wakan Tanka in Lakota), is fundamentally based on a profound, unconditional love for all creation, recognizing a deep, kinship-based interconnection (Mitakuye Oyasin) where all living things—plants, animals, and the earth—are considered relatives. This love is expressed through respect, gratitude, and stewardship rather than ownership, fostering a, "relative-like" relationship with nature.

Key aspects of how this, "Great Mystery" is based on love include:
- **Universal Interconnection (Mitakuye Oyasin)** The belief that all of nature - the four-legged's, wings of the air, and Mother Earth - are connected.
- **Kinship with All Creation:** Indigenous traditions emphasize loving one another and recognizing that the Great Spirit made and cares for all things, including plants and animals.
- **Respect and Stewardship:** Instead of viewing nature as a resource to own, humans are partners with other beings and must show respect, acknowledging that animals may be wiser and rarely forget their proper role.
- **Ceremony as Love:** Rituals are not merely, "religion" but daily practices aimed at fostering love, compassion, and finding oneself within the, "mystery of love".
- **Experiential Learning:** The, "Great Mystery" teaches that one should learn from the world (listening, observing) rather than just learning about it, recognizing the spirit within all things. 

The, "Great Mystery" is thus a, "great intimacy," where the Creator’s love is reflected in every part of the natural world, demanding that humans live in harmony and deep, loving connection with all of existence.
