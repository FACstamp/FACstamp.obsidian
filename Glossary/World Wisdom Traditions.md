#### Baháʼí

#### Christianity
Even though there are what can be called conservative and liberal interpretations of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, the most basic tenet of Christianity, as summarized in [Matthew 22:34-40](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=22&startverse=34&endverse=40), is to love thy God and thy neighbor and on these all laws shall rest.
#### Hinduism
Hinduism is fundamentally love-centered, with divine love (Brahman) seen as the core essence of the universe, often expressed through deep devotion (Bhakti) and selfless service (Seva). It emphasizes cultivating love for the divine, treating all beings with respect, and achieving liberation through passionate, selfless connection to God.
