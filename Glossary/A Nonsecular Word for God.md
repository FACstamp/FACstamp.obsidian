The FACstamp effectively needs a nonsecular word for God that does not trigger aversion by most readers while also making sense.  Here is a incomplete list of words that in the general case the FACstamp project could interchange without change or loss of meaning.
#### Christ / Universal Christ
#### God (Yahweh, Allah, Waheguru, ...)

#### Love (Agape)

#### Source

#### The Great Mystery
"[The Great Mystery](https://atmos.earth/ecological-wisdom/the-great-mystery-oceti-sakowin-ruth-hopkins/)" - [Wakan Tanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_religion) in Lakota, [Gitche Manitou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitche_Manitou) in [Anishinaabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe), refers to the supreme, all-encompassing spiritual force or Creator in many Native American belief systems, particularly among Plains nations. It represents the sacred, interconnected, and incomprehensible power that flows through all of creation—people, animals, nature, and the cosmos.  Key aspects of the Great Mystery include:
- **A "Oneness" of All Things:** It is not a personified god, but an all-encompassing life force or spirit that connects all things, often described as a "sacred" essence.
- **Takuskanskan (Movement):** In Lakota, the Great Mystery is manifested in _Takuskanskan_, which means "that which causes movement of any kind," including the wind, flowing water, and the movement of stars
- **Everyday Sacredness:** It is not distant, but exists within the void, in rocks (Inyan), the sun (Wi), the moon (Han-Wi), and the earth (Ina Maka).
- **Interconnectedness:** The concept implies that all things are related and that all living beings share a common breath.
- **Cultural Context:** While frequently associated with the Siouan-speaking peoples (Lakota, Dakota, Nakota), similar ideas exist across many indigenous nations. 

It is important to understand that the Great Mystery is, by definition, beyond human understanding, representing the totality of the sacred, rather than a single, easily defined concept.
#### Universal Consciousness
