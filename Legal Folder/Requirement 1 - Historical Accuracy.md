The FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty includes two basic definitions.  The first requirement concerns historical accuracy of the FACstamped content, referenced as ‘the what’ requirement, while [[Requirement 2 - Virtuous Delivery]] concerns how the Content is presented, referenced as ‘the how’ requirement.

The historical accuracy requirement concerns Content, with Content being defined to include news, information, and social media, printed or digital, in both written, audio, and video formats.  FACstamp itself does not define what is historically accurate but only how to determine if some Content is is historically accurate in the context of two opposing views on the determination thereof as presented in a fitness-for-use warranty claim of a Content Consumer against a Content Producer/Purveyor.  It is important to note that a significant amount of content will naturally be indeterminate with respect to the accuracy since the data required to adequately determine accuracy is not available.

Regarding historical accuracy, the FACstamp license agreement defines three subcategories of the historical accuracy of Content: False (F), Indeterminant (I), and True (T) (the FACstamp FIT rating).  Indeterminate Content is Content that cannot be determined to be True or False under the FACstamp guidelines.  For Content that has been FACstamp’ed, unless marked as False or True the Content is warrantied to be Indeterminate.  The FIT rating can be applied to sub portions of the overall FACstamp’ed Content.  For example, if the Content is in printed form, specific sections can be categorized as F, I, or T.  People who have signed a Consumer FACstamp EULA can challenge the FIT rating.

\[Implementation note: for content that is in markdown, html, or similar formats, the FIT rating could be implemented as delimiting html tags around the content.\]

Each FIT rating also supports a ‘known’ or ‘suspected/most likely’ (K/S) qualification as well, implying that the rating is either known or suspect/most likely allowing for a limited amount of nuance.

Note that regardless of FIT rating, a FACstamp Licensee is prohibited from FACstamp’ing Content mis representing the FIT rating and K/S qualification as well as not adhering to Requirement \#2.

In addition, FACstamp F or T categorization can only be applied to Content that falls into the category of provable historical news and information, specifically news/information that has occurred in the past at a specific time and location.  If it cannot be reasonably demonstrated to be False/True and accurate via the FACstamp defined methods and restrictions regarding proof of FIT, then it cannot be F or T stamped.  For example, private conversations cannot be F/T stamped due to the lack of the ability to substantiate the historical accuracy of a private conversation.  However, ‘on the record’ conversations in the general case can be F/T stamped with proper provenance.  Regardless of the actual source of the Content, a specific set of Evidence Based Methodologies are used regarding the determination of FIT rating and warranty compliance.  As an example, the Scientific Method is to be used and used without contamination of fallacious reasoning and confirmation bias based assumptions and assertions:

1. Evidence Based Methodologies including the scientific method ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific\_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method))  
2. The absence of fallacious reasoning ([https://effectiviology.com/guide-to-logical-fallacies](https://effectiviology.com/guide-to-logical-fallacies), [https://www.nizkor.org/fallacies](https://www.nizkor.org/fallacies). etc).

It is also important to note that both requirements are an integral and integrated part of the Warranty Claim Process.  When a Content Consumer files a fitness-for-use warranty claim against a Content Producer/Purveyor, the FACstamp arbitration process is grounded in both requirements: the Consumer and the Producer via their respective license agreements have agreed to act in a virtuous manner while jointly pursuing the historical accuracy of the questioned Content.
