An [Express Warranty](https://peoples-law.org/warranties#expresswarranties) is a warranty, a promise, from a manufacturer or seller of a product.  In the case of a FACstamp, the express warranty covers the fitness--of-use of the digital content that has been cryptographically signed with a FACstamp.  And in the case of a FACstamp, the fitness-of-use is defined by two requirements, [[Requirement 1 - Historical Accuracy]] and [[Requirement 2 - Virtuous Delivery]].

And as with any legal warranty, the producer or conveyor of the digital content is contractually obligated to fix the content with regards to the warranty.  The multiple ways in which this repair can take replace is defined by the [[FACstamp Warranty Claim Process]].
