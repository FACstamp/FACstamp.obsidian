Current Next Steps:
1. Looking for volunteers to participate in a design charrette to work out the high level details of the warranty claim process and other non tech/legal issues (usability, achieving project goals, etc).  See [[Volunteering]]
2. With #1, iterate again on the tech and legal challenges (see [[11 Types of Challanges|Types of Challanges]])
3. With #2, try to obtain 35k plus of initial seed money (see [[Budget Roadmap & Timeline]])
4. With #3, try to obtain a first round of either crowd or private funding (see [[Budget Roadmap & Timeline]])
