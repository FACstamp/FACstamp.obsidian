The first step is to keep the two project websites up, https://facstamp.org and this one, https://publish.obsidian.md/facstamp, which run $10/month with an approximate $25 cert fee each November.  Please consider buying me coffee which will be used to keep the servers running:

The initial financial FACstamp goal is a two step fund raising campaign within one GoFundMe campaign.  The first financial goal is $2000 for:
- $1000 to set up an organizing 501(c)(3) entity
- $1000 for various IT/ISP/website costs for 1-2 years

The second financial goal is an additional $35k for:
- $12,500 to establish a trademark claim (no code \- manual FACstamp creation)  
- $22,500 to create a professional \~3 minute FACstamp video explanation

The reason for these two initial steps is that a primary goal of the GoFundMe campaign is to create enough community interest and engagement so to be able to convene a small charrette of 4-6 volunteers, an early working board of directors, to work out white paper prototypes of the warranty claim process.  The initial $2,000 supports the legal and financial frameworks to facilitate both the convening and staffing of the charrette and the transparent and focused use of the remaining $35k.  The FACstamp video explanation can only be completed after the charrette has mostly finished its work.

The initial community engagement goal is to create a working charrette, a preliminary working board of directors, whose initial tasks are to:

- Define the high level workflows including the warranty claim process  
- Define the high level UX (user experience) of producers, purveyors, and consumers  
- Define initial and effective ways of meeting people where they are  
- Create buzz and excitement in select and limited circles  
- Create enough of a white paper prototype to facilitate further investments

Post the initial financial and engagement goals, the short term roadmap targets an initial investment round of $475,000 for investigation and prototyping that are needed to define a minimum viable product (MVP).  A second investment round of $1.2M targets the delivery of the MVP.
