Please consider volunteering with the FACstamp project!  It is a critical time in the United States of America and elsewhere.  Misinformation campaigns and non virtuous actions by some but not all leaders and hierarchies are making it difficult to discern truth from non-truth, reality from fiction, and in particular good from evil.  These are age old ethical issues amplified by the reach and speed of the Internet and today’s social media platforms.

However, the inherent anonymity and ubiquitousness of the internet is only partly to blame.  A decrease in the collective consciousness, overall discernment, and priority of the common good and our shared common humanity is a fundamental underlying issue, particularly as broadcast on social and main stream media.  Basic stoic virtue, basic Christian virtue - the basic and common virtue of all mature religions - is not being manifested to the degree necessary by society at large or on an individual basis, even if present in smaller communities.

The current FACstamp project priority is to convene a small working group, a design charrette, of perhaps 4-6 people to work out the high level workflows surrounding the actual warranty claim process.  Please consider volunteering for this design charrette or engaging in this work in some other manner.

To volunteer or become involved, please reach out via some trust-able platform, for example [linkedin](https://linkedin.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com), or ideally in person. 

Thank you.

In Peace and Discernment
