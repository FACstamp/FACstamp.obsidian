## Fostering Accuracy, Authenticity, and Community in Communications and Content

## 1\) Summary

The two goals of the “Fostering Accuracy, Authenticity, and Community in Communications and Content (FAC)” project, a.k.a. FACstamp, is to 1\) foster the authenticity, accuracy, and trustworthiness in news and information and 2\) foster a community of common humanity, care, safety, and trust.  Said again but somewhat differently, FACstamp fosters greater individual and collective consciousness \- greater wisdom of heart and mind \- via an interactive and responsible conveyance of news and information.  The project centers around the creation of a registered trademark with an associated licensable digital stamp.  One or more patents on the technology necessary to implement the stamp may be possible.

The underlying trademark, stamp, license agreement, and patents are owned by a 501(c)(3) entity, the Licensor.  People who sign the FACstamp license agreement, Licensees, agree to abide by the terms of the FACstamp license when creating/applying a FACstamp to content.  Licensees who create or deliver news and information (Content) can **optionally** create a digital FACstamp associated with the specific Content.  The stamp contains a signed/secured reference (a.k.a. a digest) of the specific Content, the identity of the Licensor and Licensee, etc.  When a Licensee creates a stamp for specific Content, the stamp contains a QR code pointing to a unique internet location managed by the Licensor.

For people who read/view/consume FACstamp’ed Content (Consumers), such Consumers can rely on the Content abiding by the representations and warranties specified in the license agreement associated with the FACstamp.  The representations and warranties basically define a fitness-for-use that includes both a specific definition of Historical Accuracy (requirement \#1) and Responsible Delivery (requirement \#2). This effectively creates an expressed warranty allowing a Consumer to rely on the Content being fit-for-use where fit-for-use is the ability to use the Content to make informed and accurate decisions while also being able to safely consume the Content free of human directed hate or ill will and rhetorical mechanisms such as othering, context-switching, and gaslighting.  Requirement \#2 creates a supremacy of consciousness and freedom of accurately informed and emotionally balanced choice, a.k.a. maximized wisdom, by the Consumer.

Critically, the license agreement also specifies the mitigation/arbitration process that is followed to make a claim or counterclaim against a Licensee regarding their FACstamp’ed Content.  Consumers are free to litigate anything, sure, but the FACstamp claim/counterclaim warranty process is specifically defined and requires a Consumer to agree to the Consumer FACstamp EULA (End User License Agreement) to register a FACstamp warranty claim.

As an analogy, the FACstamp is similar to Underwriters Laboratories (UL) stamps.  As the mission of Underwriter Laboratories is to make the world a safer place electrically by shepherding a quality standard for electronic devices, the FACstamp project mission is to do the same for news and information.  And to do that via two specific goals: to have news and information be historically accurate and be responsibly delivered.  FACstamp is also somewhat similar to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.

Note \- the FACstamp is different then the [C2PA stamp](https://c2pa.org) \- the C2PA stamp is focused on source provenance where FACstamp is focused on a specific and limited definition of provable historical accuracy, a specific criteria of responsible delivery, and a specific mediation process when there are warranty claims.

## 2\) What Problems is FACstamp Addressing?

[[Problems, Solutions, and What If's]] contains a summary of problems that FACstamp is addressing along with additional downstream opportunities.

## 3\) Costs / Investments

The initial investment request is $475,000 with a second round of $1.2M.  The first round is consumed by seven people: product owner, UX expert, data model expert, business development expert, plus 3 attorneys (arbitration, trademark/patent, software license) over two months at an average of $200/hour.  The second round is consumed by ten people (the same seven plus two software developers and a security expert) over 4 months at about the same average $200/hour with \~$100k in capital expenses.  Total project timeline is six months to produce a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  The first round determines business strategies and market potentials as well as the basic UX and data model roadmaps.  The second round delivers the MVP for those roadmaps.  See [[Budget and Roadmap]].

## 4\) Network Effects

There are two domains where [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect://www.nfx.com/post/network-effects-manual) are important aspects regarding FACstamp.  The first is the defense of the financial existence of the licensor including the investors thereof.  The second is the actual end goal \- the defense of the integrity, trustworthiness, and efficacy of the fitness-for-use warranty that the FACstamp provides to Consumers.  Both domains support each other and need to be compelling.  The latter domain needs to be effectively realized quickly to maximize certain network effects.

Once early adopters rollout FACstamps, there will be network effect pressures for others to do the same.  This is true for news outlets, bloggers, and influencers (all different).  Given the current level of the ‘destruction of the trustworthiness’ of news and information, there is currently large consumer pressure across both news and social media for trustworthy news and information which is not solely determined to be accurate by a seemingly remote and independent third party.  The accuracy and trustworthiness needs to be more directly mitigatable between the two parties involved.  Unlike the UL stamps which are authorized by a central agency, FACstamp is effectively a distributed arbitration system directly involving the Consumer and the Licensee via a specific warranty claim process.  It is the warranty claim process that is controlled by the Licensor.  But similar to the UL stamp, once FACstamp, which is also protected by trademark and patents on the tech side, gains that beachhead of “oh we need this, it works, and it is good’, the initial network effect will be established.  And though \~20-25% of the population will never trust a FACstamp, FACstamp is primarily targeting the middle 60% of the population which can be swayed towards accurate news and community unison and away from fake news and division.  And in democracies the middle 60% is the group that end up electing the officials who govern.

## 5\) Community Effects

One potential adoption model of FACstamp’s and FACID’s to introduce into various levels of hierarchical system and/or power structures.  This could be non-commercial/non-profit communities such as substack channels, dedicated affinity and/or church groups, and community groups such as [https://350.org/](https://350.org/), [https://frontporchforum.com/](https://frontporchforum.com/), etc.  It could also be leveraged by for-profit groups and portals such as social media portals, mainstream media portals, corporate, and government agencies and elected bodies.  Whatever the hierarchical system, by getting a critical mass of ‘congregates/members/participants’ to FACstamp their Content, FACstamps can be slowly adopted upwards or downwards within the various hierarchical structures.  One goal of this process is to move FACstamp adoption into the political realm via adoption by elected and appointed officials.

## 6\) Tech Notes

The basic technology is to use a public ledger (a Merkle Tree) owned and managed by the Licensor that allows Licensees to directly upload static Content and supply a FACstamp (green) for that specific Content.  Changes to the Content, either due to self corrections or corrections via FACstamp warranty claims, are tracked in the public ledger.  Non-compliant FACstamps (e.g. red) are supported which denote content that is not historically accurate or responsibly delivered.  Warranty claims brought by Consumers are also tracked in the public ledger.  Dynamic Content, such as live audio, video, and text feeds, can be provisionally FAAC stamped under certain conditions and follows a strict full-circle process resulting in either a compliant or non-compliant FACstamp being rendered on a digitally signed copy of the live Content.

Regarding actual tech, the back office solution could range from various hyperledger fabrics (e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/)) to [GitHub](https://github.com/) (e.g. a git based [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) \- see [VTP](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project/VoteTrackerPlus)).
