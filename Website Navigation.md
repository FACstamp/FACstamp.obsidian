With the exception of the [[Welcome]] landing page, there is no single path through this website.  FACstamp spans four major and separate domains:
- Cryptographic and general software technology
- Legal terms, concepts, and procedures
- Human usability, interaction, and communication 
- Social and mainstream media digital content production and consumption 

As visitors to this site can have greatly different backgrounds and areas of interest, this site employs the [[Using Obsidian|Obsidian]] to maintain the website you are reading.  This supports a freer and more fluid ability for website visitors with different backgrounds to find the information of interest and in a form that makes sense to them.
