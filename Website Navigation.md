🚧 Under Construction 🚧

### There is no single primary landing page
There are several goals and principles driving the FACstamp project.  As such there will likely be several primary landing pages depending how someone may encounter FACstamp for the first time.
### Meta notes
1) Obsidian is being used as the display technology to the FACstamp.org content, leveraging Obsidian tags, links, and backlinks
2) Git and GitHub are being used manage content change, leveraging content change discussions, pull-requests, and development
3) Once there is a budget, Obsidian Publish will be used to provide an Internet access to FACstamp.org.  Until then, users can pull the GitHub repository(s) into a local Obsidian vault for either viewing and/or development
4) This project, FACstamp.org, may undergo significant organizational refactoring as content is created and added
