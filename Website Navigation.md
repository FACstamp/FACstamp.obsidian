### There is no single path to navigate through this website
With the exception of the [[README]] landing page, there is no single path through this website.  FACstamp spans four major and separate domains:
- Cryptographic and general software technology
- Legal terms, concepts, and procedures
- Human usability, interaction, and communication 
- Social and mainstream media digital content production and consumption 
As visitors to this site can have greatly different backgrounds and areas of interest, this site employs the [Obsidian application](https://obsidian.md/) and [publish service](https://obsidian.md/publish) to maintain the website you are reading.  This allows a much freer and fluid capability for the website visitor to find the information of interest and to easily navigate to additional and related documentation.

However, if you are just curious in general regarding the FACstamp project, a suggested initial navigation through this website is:

1) See [[FACstamp Pitch]]
2) Then [[FACstamp Introduction]]
3) For more high level details, please see [[FACstamp Deeper Dive]]
4) There is also an additional two page on [[FACIDs]] and how they relate to FACstamps
5) See [[Problems and Solutions]] for a six page summary of 21 mostly fundamental social, civic, and ethical problems and their FACstamp solutions
6) Details regarding [[Requirement 1]] - historical accuracy, the what requirement
7) Details regarding [[Requirement 2]] - virtuous delivery, the how requirement

See [[Volunteering]] for how to get involved and/or start contributing somehow.
