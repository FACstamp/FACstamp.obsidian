This is the GitHub/Git README file for the FACstamp.obsidian repository.  The real user facing landing page is actually [Welcome](Welcome.md).  Regardless, this repository is the actual user facing FACstamp documentation which is developed in and displayed via the Obsidian application.  As such please see [https://publish.obsidian.md/facstamp](https://publish.obsidian.md/facstamp) to view the contents of this repo.

Note:  the Obsidian application maintains all the explicit links (in Wikilink and not in markdown format) and live generated backlinks as well as the graph view, etc - see [[Using Obsidian]].

Note: that the [FACstamp.org](https://facstamp.org) domain website points to both [https://publish.obsidian.md/facstamp](https://publish.obsidian.md/facstamp) and this [README](https://github.com/FACstamp/FACstamp.obsidian) - see [Using Obsidian](Volunteering/Using%20Obsidian) for more info.

Note: most everything here is under active development.

See [Volunteering](Volunteering/Volunteering.md) for volunteering and contributing to this project.

Thanks for being here.
