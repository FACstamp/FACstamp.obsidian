## What is FACstamp?
FACstamp is a project to help support trustable, non duplicitous human communication:
- Technically, FACstamp is a set of software applications leveraging cryptographic and public ledger technologies providing highly secure digital identity and content management
- Legally, FACstamp is a set of  software agreements dealing with the creation, publication, and follow-up communication regarding digital multi media and content
- Usage wise, FACstamp supports an [Expressed Warranty](https://peoples-law.org/warranties#expresswarranties) of Fitness-for-Use that end users or applications can use to inspect Fitness-for-Use compliance of digital content that has been cryptographically stamped and signed with a FACstamp

## Why FACstamp?
With the accelerating use of  the Internet, the ability to discern accurate information delivered with virtuous intention has become challenging, time consuming, and an increasing insurmountable challenge.   A true democracy, one that is not a democracy in name only, requires the electorate to be accurately informed (accurate information) without associated duplicitous logic, rationalizations, and/or rhetoric (non virtuous manipulation and bamboozlement).  FACstamp is a project aimed at addressing this basic difficulty.

## What is the FACstamp Expressed Warranty of Fitness of Use?
A key aspect of FACstamp is that when digital content is stamped with a FACstamp, consumers of that content have access to an Expressed Warranty of Fitness of Use.  FACstamp merchantability is defined by two primary requirements, the first being an historical accuracy clause and the second being a virtuous and duplicity free delivery clause.
