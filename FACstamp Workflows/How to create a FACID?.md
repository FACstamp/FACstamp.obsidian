The basic workflow for creating a FACID is for new FACID users to authenticate themselves when in the same location and in the presence of an existing FACID user and when registering themselves against a known and legal name and address.  (There is a FACID smart device app that facilitates this.)  The address and name are primarily taken from public voter registration databases but alternative methods are also supported.

Another example of online authentication is how [Clear](https://www.clearme.com/) is integrated with [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).

FACID's are also intended to be reverified on a regular basis with an appropriate level of turn key 2FA.
