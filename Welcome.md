The FACstamp project is just getting off ground and is in the initial planning stages.  Volunteers are needed - please consider [[Volunteering]], perhaps becoming a board member participating in future design charrettes, or helping with some aspect of the project such as creating documentation or writing code.  Financial contributions are deeply appreciated via [Buy Me Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/windoverwater) to cover current [[Budget Roadmap & Timeline|expenses]].  A future GoFundMe campaign is in the works.

### What is FACstamp?
FACstamp is a project to help support trustable, non duplicitous human communication via digital content:

- Technically, FACstamp is a set of software applications leveraging cryptographic and public ledger technologies providing highly secure digital identity, privacy, and content management

- Legally, FACstamp is a set of  software agreements dealing with the creation, publication, and follow-up communication and verification regarding digital multi media and content

- Usage wise, FACstamp supports an [Expressed Warranty](https://peoples-law.org/warranties#expresswarranties) of Fitness-for-Use that end users or applications can use to inspect Fitness-for-Use compliance of digital content that has been cryptographically stamped and signed with a FACstamp

- There are significant potential [[Market Analysis|new markets]] that FACstamp adoption will create as it solves an impressive list of [[Internet Problems and FACstamp Solutions|fundamental issues]] currently plaguing how digital content is produced and consumed on the Internet

### Why FACstamp?
With the accelerating use of the Internet, the ability to discern accurate information delivered with virtuous intention has become difficult, time consuming, and an increasing insurmountable challenge.  A true democracy, one that is not a democracy in name only, requires the electorate to be accurately informed (accurate information) without associated biases or duplicitous logic and rhetoric, a.k.a. without duplicitous manipulation and bamboozlement.  The electorate should also be discerning sans both individual and cultural biases.  FACstamp is a project aimed at addressing these basic difficulties.

A primary goal of FACstamp is to positively affect 1-10 million voters within one year of general availability of a minimal viable product (MVP).  By increasing the collective consciousness of the voting electorate, a democracy is stabilized against misinformation, civic decay, and the loss of virtue particularly within the government.

### What is the FACstamp Expressed Warranty of Fitness of Use?
A key aspect of FACstamp concerns the [[Express Warranty of Fitness-For-Use]] that is managed by the various FACstamp license and usage agreements.  When digital content is stamped with a FACstamp, consumers of that content have access to the [[Express Warranty of Fitness-For-Use]].  This FACstamp merchantability is defined by two primary requirements, the [[Requirement 1 - Historical Accuracy|first requirement]] is a historical accuracy clause while the [[Requirement 2 - Virtuous Delivery|second requirement]] is a virtuous and duplicity free delivery clause.  See [[FACstamp Deeper Dive]] for more details.
