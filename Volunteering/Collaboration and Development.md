FACstamp development employs a combination of Git, GitHub, and Obsidian to manage change.

First, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) are used for everything.  GitHub [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) is used for discussions, questions, etc and GitHub [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues) are used for collaborative software and documentation development.  See [[Using Git & GitHub]].

This website is essentially an Obsidian vault named FACstamp.obsidian stored as a Git repository on GitHub located at https://github.com/FACstamp/FACstamp.obsidian.  See [[Using Obsidian]].
