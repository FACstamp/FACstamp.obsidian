Please consider volunteering with the FACstamp project!  It is a critical time in the United States of America and democracies every where.  Misinformation campaigns and non virtuous actions by some leaders and organizational hierarchies are making it difficult to discern truth from non-truth, reality from fiction, and virtuous from the duplicitous.  These are age old ethical issues but they are being amplified by the reach and speed of the Internet and today’s social media platforms.

However, the inherent anonymity and ubiquitousness of the internet is only partly to blame.  A decrease in the ability of the collective consciousness to discern good and truth from evil and fiction, and a decrease in the effective prioritization of the common good and our shared common humanity, has become a fundamental underlying issue, particularly as social and main stream media has is loosing this ability.  Basic stoic virtue, basic Christian virtue - the basic and common virtue of all mature religions - is not being manifested to the degree necessary by society at large and sometimes on an individual basis as well.

The FACstamp project is aimed at addressing this fundamental issue as it occurs on the internet and in social and main stream media outlets and sources.  It is a moonshot and still in the exploratory phase.

The current FACstamp project priority is to convene a small working group, a design charrette, of perhaps 4-6 people to work out the high level workflows surrounding the actual warranty claim process.  Please consider volunteering for this design charrette or engaging in this work in some other manner.  See [[Budget Roadmap & Timeline]]

To volunteer or become involved, please reach out via some trust-able platform, for example [linkedin](https://linkedin.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com), or ideally in person.

In Peace and Discernment
