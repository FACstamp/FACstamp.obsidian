In 1943 Abraham Maslow published a pivotal paper, “[A Theory of Human Motivation](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm)”, that included his well published pyramid of needs:

![[Maslow 1943 pyramid.png | center | 500]]

What is less known is that with further research and observation he later revised the above pyramid to include a higher level:

![[Maslow 6 pyramid.png|500]]

A reason to mention this is that only the first triangle was well published and is in conflict with many of the [[World Wisdom Traditions]].  Love/God/ centered religions, philosophies, and belief systems include the needs of others in a manner that requires the acknowledgement and importance of a shared common humanity.  With respect to Maslow's original pyramid, that *need* is not present.

Note - Maslow actually subdivided the original five levels into seven while also adding self-transcendence as the top and final stage of the pyramid.  His final pyramid was:

![[Maslov 8 triangle.png|500]]

Note - the 50 year 'rollout' of Maslow's hierarchical theory of human needs might be considered an example of [[Good and Bad Science|incomplete science]] in that an inaccurate picture of human growth was published without the acknowledgement of the unfinished nature of the research.  This is particularly relevant regarding the relative importance of self actualization and self transcendence.  Specifically, the original pyramid showed the final stage of human development to be the realization of the potential of ones own physical/mental self, a.k.a the prioritization of [[Egoic-self|egoic self]].  Without self-transcendence as the top goal, [[Hierarchical Power Structures]] can more easily fail to be in alignment with [[World Wisdom Traditions]], failing to be love centered and instead be based more on [[Othering|othering]].

Note - this line of reasoning is not assigning ill intent towards Maslow or the psychology community as there is an important difference between [[Intent and Impact]].

Regardless, one of the goals of the FACstamp project is to support individuals and communities shifting [[Hierarchical Power Structures]] into greater alignment with [[World Wisdom Traditions]].
