In 1943 Abraham Maslow published a pivotal paper, “[A Theory of Human Motivation](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm)”, that included his well published pyramid of needs:

![[Maslow 1943 pyramid.png | center | 500]]

What is less known is that with further research and observation he later revised the above pyramid to include a higher level:

![[Maslow 6 pyramid.png|500]]

A reason to mention this is that only the first triangle was well published and is in conflict with many of the [[World Wisdom Traditions]].  Love/God/ centered religions, philosophies, and belief systems include the needs of others in a manner that requires the acknowledgement and importance of a shared common humanity.  With respect to Maslow's original pyramid, that *need* is not present.

Note - Maslow actually subdivided the original five levels into seven while also adding self-transcendence as the top and final stage of the pyramid.  His final pyramid was:

Note - the 50 year 'rollout' of Maslow's hierarchical theory of human needs can be considered an example of [[Good and Bad Science|faulty science]] in that an inaccurate picture of human growth was taught to students and the public in general without the acknowledgement of the unfinished nature of the research.  This is particularly relevant regarding self transcendence as the top goal because it is possible to use the original pyramid as a justification for the prioritization of [[Egoic-self|egoic self]] interests.  Without self-transcendence as the top goal it is easier to justify [[Hierarchical Power Structures]] that are not love centered and based on [[Othering]] a class of people.  This is not assigning ill intent towards Maslow (note the difference between [[Intent and Impact]]) nor claiming that science in general is faulty.  It is simply acknowledging the potential impact on [[World Wisdom Traditions|wisdom communities]] of the incremental rollout of a conflicting incomplete theory.
