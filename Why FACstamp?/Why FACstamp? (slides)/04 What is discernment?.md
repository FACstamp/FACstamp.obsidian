 [[03 What is 'consciousness'?|Previous Slide]]  |  [[05 Problem 2|Next Slide]] 
Discernment - the ability to discern fallacious logic, biased reasoning, and misinformation from sound logic, unbiased reasoning, and good data.

Discernment and consciousness are intimately related, one leads to the other.  It is also an important question of where the supremacy of discernment and conscious resides:  either innately in every human being or in the written dogma/dharma of hierarchies of social systems or their leaders - the church, the government, the expert, or the leader.
