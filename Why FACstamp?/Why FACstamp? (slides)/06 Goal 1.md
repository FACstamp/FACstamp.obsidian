 [[05 Problem 2|Previous]]  |  [[07 Goal 2|Next]] 
To help everyone, but in particular 1-10M swing-able voters, increasing both individual and collective consciousness and discernment.

This goal aligns with all mature religions and philosophical traditions. The FACstamp and FACID license agreements, documentation, and portals are tuned to maximally meet people where they are in their framework of choice.

#### Achieving Goal 1:

- Leveraging Nonviolent Communication ([NVC](https://www.cnvc.org/)), [Braver Angel](https://braverangels.org/) processes, and Internal Family Systems ([IFS](https://ifs-institute.com/)) in the FACstamp warranty claims process, or any other mature unbiased arbitration process
- Leveraging multi variant portals, documentation, license agreements via link-based, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) like portals

An important guideline in an effort to increase consciousness, awareness, and/or discernment is not to actually say that the goal is to do just that.  Note [debating](https://karintamerius.substack.com/p/why-debating-republicans-almost-never) (TBD).

A second guideline is to meet to listener/participant where they are and in their framework/context and not ask/force them to change in that manner.
