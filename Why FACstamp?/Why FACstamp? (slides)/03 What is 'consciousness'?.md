Consciousness is a challenging word and concept to pin down to a specific definition or *understanding*.  The word itself and the implied meaning can be understood differently by every sentient being.  As such the FACstamp project only employs a lightweight and incomplete, nonsecular definition:

- Consciousness is the state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings, as well as one's own internal thoughts, feelings, and sensations.   It represents the first-person, subjective experience of existence—or "what it is like" to be a specific person—ranging from wakefulness to deep sleep.

Regardless of specific definition, there is additional concept of what is meant when one refers to a shift from *lesser* consciousness to *greater* consciousness.  This shift is not a shift along the lines of less sleepiness as when waking up in the morning.  The shift towards greater consciousness is measured via a different metric - the ability to 'take into active account' more contexts of both physical reality and/or transcendent aspects thereof, particularly when those contexts may be non conceptual in themselves.

For FACstamp, this shift is the same shift that many [[World Wisdom Traditions]] speak to using words and concepts specific to that tradition.  Using a similar nonsecular definition as the above:

- Greater consciousness is the increase in the ability of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings as well as one's own internal thoughts, feelings, and sensations.  This increase in ability is directly associated with an identity shift from [[Egoic-self]] to the non egoic-self via  transcendence of the egoic-self.   See [[Maslow's Pyramids]].

This shift, even as defined in a limited manner in a nonsecular manner, is a key concept and general guidance of many of the world wisdom traditions.  And it is based on this observation that FACstamp creates a [[Requirement 2 - Virtuous Delivery]] as a key aspect of the project.
