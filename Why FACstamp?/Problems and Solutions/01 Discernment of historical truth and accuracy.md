There is no easy way for content consumers to differentiate historical fact from fiction.  This is particularly true for the average content consumer and voter.  Even news and information geeks can find it challenging and time consuming.  Note the discernment between false and truth for any given Content is not just momentary \- the discernment continues post consuming the information.  In addition, knowing the accuracy prior to consuming the information saves time.

FACstamp directly supports this by supplying a color coded cryptographic digital stamp where the color coding is the live historical fact FIT status (False, Indeterminate, True) and KS rating (Known, Suspected).  Clicking the stamp or snapping the QR code will take the consumer to the FACstamp portal for that content where the user can spelunk for more provenance and version information as well as the FACstamp network graph of any FACstamp references or backlinks.  It is important to note that the FIT and K/S status is live and based on real and current data \- it can change over time.  All FACstamp data is contained in a public ledger which records all transactions, so nothing is lost and FACstamp data history cannot be changed without significant notice.

Note that no Consumer FACstamp License agreement or login is required to access this information.  However the portal is limited to human interaction while API access is available as a subscription service.
