Many modern cultures effectively do not prioritize what can be traced back to historic stoic virtues or other virtue systems.  Another effective name for stoic virtue is wisdom-consciousness, which speaks to the inherent wisdom that can be expressed by wise individuals and many cultures.  The FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty claim process shepherds both the Consumer and Producer/Purveyor through a wisdom-consciousness based process, whether that process is implemented via [Nonviolent Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) or leverages [Braver Angels](https://braverangels.org/).
