When FACstamped historical accuracy or virtuous delivery  ‘appears’ to contradict an aspect of a belief system that an individual or group has identified with, science and/or stoic virtue can become an enemy.  FACstamp’s Requirement 1 honors the Consumer’s supremacy of conscious and free choice and attempts to not threaten Consumers so identified \- they should be able to feel safe and unthreatened reading FACstamp Content.  However, that does not mean that the Content does not describe actions, events, and aspects associated with the belief system in a positive or supportive manner.  Evil, hate, violence, and non virtuous actions and events can be (need to be) called out; it is just that they are called out in a manner that still respects to the extent possible the common humanity shared by us all.  FACstamp Content supports as much as possible the inclusion of all people while ‘calling out’ unvirtuous, evil, unscrupulous, or violent actions and events.
