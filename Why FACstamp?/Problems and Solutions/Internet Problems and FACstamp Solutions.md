There are at least four fundamental issues with the World Wide Web, a.k.a. the Internet:
1) Ubiquitous anonymity
2) Fake news
3) Extensive knavery - extensive data and cognitive theft
4) Loss of provenance & safety of locality - humans now operate instantly at any distance
#### Ubiquitous Anonymity
A fundamental issue with the World Wide Web, the Internet, as it is constructed and used today stems from the inherent anonymity of users and the potential proliferation of fake internet identities, identities that are not human beings.  [[Requirement 0 - Authenticity]] addresses this issue.
#### Fake News
A second fundamental issue with the Internet is the ease of creating and the proliferation of  fake news, and the speed at which it can spread.  [[Requirement 1 - Historical Accuracy]] tackles this issue.  See also [[Making Good & Accurate News Faster]] 
#### Extensive Knavery
A third fundamental issue with the Internet, enabled by the first two issues described above, is the non virtuous and duplicity of digital content.  Human duplicity is perhaps as old as  the human race - the ability for a person to act deceitfully and  take advantage, to steal something of another.  Before electricity and the internet, the theft could be food and physical objects, or the theft could be health (to hurt) or life itself (to kill).  But with the discovery of electricity and the invention of the World Wide Web, non virtuous and duplicitous human action can now concern data, not just stealing data but also by creating fake and inaccurate data.  Such data knaves effectively steal the decisions of others - cognitive theft.  Cognitive theft is like a human generated cognitive virus.  [[Requirement 2 - Virtuous Delivery]] tackles this issue.
#### Loss of Safety of Locality
There is a fourth fundamental issue with the Internet that exasperates all of the above, and that is the ability of the Internet to allow human interaction at a distance.  Where as before the time of electricity and Internet data, humans more or less had to be co-located physically to interact, whether that interaction was virtuous or not.  Virtuous assistance or duplicitous/evil theft was more or less limited to being physically co-located, limited to being neighbors.  But with the Internet, human interaction can occur at any physical distance.  And with this distance data and cognitive theft becomes psychologically easier to execute by the perpetrator as it is easier to fall victim to.  Since [[Requirement 0 - Authenticity]] is tied to physical location, namely voting location, the combination of all three FACstamp requirements is tackling this fourth fundamental issue with the Internet.

A short summary list of the problems that FACstamp addresses and its respective solutions.  The second list is more of a hypothetical list of potential problems that FACstamp can also address.
