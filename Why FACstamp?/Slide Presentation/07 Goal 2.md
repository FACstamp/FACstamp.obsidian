 [[06 Goal 1|Previous]]  |  [[08 FACstamp Technology Summary|Next]] 
Create a safe and an effective, guardrailed, distributed process for resolving observations of historical events to the extent possible within the context of Goal 1.

FACstamp is not so much about ascertaining truth as it is about resolving differences in observations of historical events where a resolution is reasonable and possible.  The latter is different then the former, with the latter being contained in a distributed public ledger that assures accurate history and distribution.

#### Achieving Goal 2:

- Leveraging the fitness-for-use legal concept on digital content
- Requiring signed license agreements for both Content Producers and warranty claims

**Similar to the Underwriter Laboratory seal (UL) and the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, FACstamp is a digital seal on digital content.  A content producer must sign a software licence to be able to stamp content and a content consumer must sign a license to file a fitness-for-use warranty claim.  A license agreement is NOT necessary to simply use FACstamps as a viewer/reader.**
