Regarding hierarchical power structures such as businesses, corporations, and governments, employees/citizens might micro-share their FACIDs (with a certain level of anonymity) to gain critical mass of FACID adoption.  With a certain level of adoption the employees/citizens could ask other levels in the hierarchy to also obtain/use FACID/FACstamps.  The goal is to raise FACID/FACstamp compliance in the hierarchical organizations and communities in which they participate.  The moral dilemma being addressed by this scenario is the problematic reality that money and power corrupts \- it is challenging to remain virtuous as one gains power and wealth.  The idea is that as a group within a hierarchical power structure gains critical FACID adoption, the group can ask another hierarchical group to also obtain and use FACIDs and FACstamps.
