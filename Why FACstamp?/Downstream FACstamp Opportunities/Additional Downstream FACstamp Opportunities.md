Only human beings can obtain a FACstamp license and a [FACID](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1YVqu2WcwWs4DcwRit71nmY71KicRNEKGxInupWymlyE/edit), and both are required to create FACstamps.  Bots, software and AI programs, businesses, corporations, and governments cannot FACstamp content.  Given this restriction and the Producer/Purveyor and Consumer license restrictions, secondary, downstream, and indirect use cases can come into play.  Some of these are:

[[01 Social media content providers may FACstamp their content]]
[[02 Social media sites may require a FACID for uploading comments]]
[[03 Social media subscribers might require FACstamps for news and information]]
[[04 Social media subscribers might require FACstamps for ads, marketing, and advertisements]]
[[05 Private and public events, such as rallies, marches, and demonstrations, may ask participants to register their FACIDs]]
[[06 Brick & mortar establishments may leverage FACstamps]]
[[07 Hierarchical power structures such as businesses, corporations, and governments, are comprised of employees citizens]]
[[08 Voters might ask their elected and non-elected officials to obtain FACIDs & FACstamps and to agree to conduct their official duties under their EULAs]]
[[09 FACIDs could be leveraged significantly beyond FACstamp usage]]
[[10 The license agreements behind FACID and FACstamps could be used as templates]]

## Can FACIDs and FACstamps improve generative AI Models?

FACIDs and FACstamps are limited to human beings.  To be sentient and conscious is a requirement for the ability to assess historical accuracy of content as well as its virtuous delivery.  Bots and software programs, AI based or otherwise, and businesses, corporations, and governments cannot obtain either FACIDs or FACstamps.

Regarding AI models, for example LLM chat and search sites, what if the officers of the company producing the AI model were able to combine their personal FACstamps to create a special generative AI model FACstamp?  The generative FACstamp would furnish two important guardrails regarding generative AI Content:

1) A generative AI FACstamp would provide a liability barrier between the generative AI model end-users, who may be FACID owners, and the officers of the company.  Limiting such liability would support greater possibilities for investment and innovation.  
2) A generative AI FACstamp would provide a provenance and fitness-for-use of the content being generated and consumed.  As artificial intelligence is not the same thing as consciousness, there is significant social and civic interest for the ability to determine the fitness-for-use of generative AI content.  As FACID and FACstamp information is both ‘live’ and versioned via public ledger technology similar to blockchain technologies, generative AI as well as its end-users can more deeply investigate FACID and FACstamp provenance and hence provenance in general.  
   
In summary a generative AI FACstamp could be of high value to society.
