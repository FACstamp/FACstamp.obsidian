In any private or public gathering, in person or online, the organizers may ask the participants to identify themselves with FACIDs.  Note that FACIDs support known anonymity, meaning that that actual identity of the FACID may not be known even while the FACID is known to be currently valid.  This can be done within say ‘micro-groups’ within the larger group or as a single group.  For example, the organizers may ask the participants to use their FACID to identify their immediate neighbors and while doing so to agree to event guidelines such as non-violent behavior and other safety guidelines.  It also can give the organizers an exact count of the number of people attending even when such information is anonymous (FACID owners always control the degree of anonymity of their FACID usage).
