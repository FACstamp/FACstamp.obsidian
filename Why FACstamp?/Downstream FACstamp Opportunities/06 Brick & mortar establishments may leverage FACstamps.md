Brick and mortar establishments may display a business owner/operator FACstamp to denote a promise of some level of civil engagement or provenance of available physical goods, such as food, and services, in addition to any available Content, if any.  The FACstamp fitness-for-use warranty (the two FACstamp requirements) can be used to extend the coverage to for example the organic nature, non GMO nature, or carbon footprint cost of goods and services.  The displayed FACstamp that contains the warranty extension can be recorded by the customer and potentially be used to make a future warranty claim if for example the purchased goods and services do not meet the extended fitness-for-use warranty.
